## Getting Started

The following two methods describe how to use NewsApp in your web browser.


### Install on your PC

       git clone (https://github.com/jynt1401/.flo_News_app) 
    
    *Note that if you forked .flo NewsApp, the above command should be edited to clone your fork.*

2. Initialize the theme:
